# GFS Bias Correction using Graph Neural Networks

This project implements a deep learning model in PyTorch for bias correction of GFS (Global Forecast System) temperature forecasts using ERA5 data (ground truth) as a reference. The goal is to reduce forecast biases in GFS 2m temperature forecasts by training a neural network to predict unbiased GFS data based on ERA5 observations.

## Background

The GFS is a widely used weather forecasting system, but it may contain biases in temperature predictions. Bias correction is essential to improve the accuracy of these forecasts. This project presents a PyTorch-based bias correction model that learns to predict unbiased GFS temperature forecasts by comparing them with ERA5 data, which serves as the ground truth.

## Getting Started
